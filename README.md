## Projects

### [Project 1: Data Job Market Analysis](https://github.com/nshrimal11/Data_Job_Market_Project) 

This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively as well as to aid me in my job search. It delves into top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

Below are the questions I answer in my project:

 - What are the most in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
 - How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
 - How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
 - What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn?
